# Capstone Project - 32iQ

## Problem Statement & Motivation:

32iQ is an analytics and computer vision platform that can be used as a diagnostic aid on panoramic x-ray images. 

In the field of dentistry, radiological errors frequently contribute to misdiagnoses for patients, with perceptual errors accounting for nearly 70% of misdiagnoses - our mission is to enable healthcare professionals to efficiently triage dental ailments sooner, thereby improving outcomes for patients.Â
