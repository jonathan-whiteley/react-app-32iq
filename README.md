# Capstone Project - 32iQ

In the field of dentistry, radiological errors frequently contribute to misdiagnoses for patients, with perceptual errors accounting for nearly 70% of misdiagnosis. Missed or delayed diagnoses often lead to patient harm and missed opportunities for treatment.1

### Our Mission:
1. Enable healthcare professional to efficiently triage serious dental issues sooner
2. Improve outcomes for patients with limited access to dental care expertise

We do this by providing a low cost, easy to use, analytics + computer vision platform that can be used as a diagnostic aid on panoramic x-ray images.
